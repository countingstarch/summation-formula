Note to self:
- Fix the normal summation function for negative numbers
- Remove the n/k integer requirement
- Remove the p <= k limit
  - You can just do something similar to n!-m! (you have a draft of this. Develop it)
- After the above are fixed, check to see if it works with other numbers
- Make a README
